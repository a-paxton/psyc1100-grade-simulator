# Grade simulator for PSYC 1100 (Spring 2020)

A tiny Shiny app for students to simulate their final grades for PSYC 1100-020
(University of Connecticut), including an estimate of what would be needed on
the Optional Final to make a D- (the lowest passing grade) and a C in the class.

You can find the deployed app here: https://a-paxton.shinyapps.io/psyc1100-grade-simulator/

With conceptual thanks to Julia J. C. Blau (CCSU), who graciously provided me
with an early template for a grade calculator in Excel.
