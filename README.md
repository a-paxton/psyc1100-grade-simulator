# Grade simulator for PSYC 1100 (Fall 2023)

A tiny Shiny app for students to simulate their grade bundles for PSYC 1100
(University of Connecticut), including the opportunity to explore different
performance based on different grades on their Cumulative Final.

with an early template for a grade calculator in Excel.
